        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <p id="overviewp">In the spring of 1692, tragic events followed in the town of Salem, and surrounding areas. The Salem Witch Trials followed with 200 
            accused and 20 executed publicly; 8 of which were hung by rope... to death. 
            <br>
            The unfortunate events took place in Salem, Massachussets. 
            With several young girls in hysteria claiming of devil possession, fingers were pointed to witchcraft and names were thrown out in blame.
            Both men and women were victims of this horrifying time in history. Trials were conducted in the courthouse in Salem and what proceeded was
            the first witch to be hung in Salem's Gallows Hill with more individuals who awaited their fate of execution. 
            <br>
            Eventually, the trials would 
            subside due to public disagreement amongst Massachussets. Later on, convicted witches would be pardoned. History would be made with such
            heinous acts committed, with Salem enduring it for centuries to come.
